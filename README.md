Malware detection with image representation and Markov Chain

This is the reposo]itory of our paper "A Study on Image-based Representation Malware Detection Utilizing Extended Malimg Dataset"

We compare two different image representation with Grayscale image and High Order Markov Chain for malware detection.  
We extended Malimg dataset with benign samples for malware detection. The benign samples were collected and validated.
